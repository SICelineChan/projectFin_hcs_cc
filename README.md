# projectFin_hcs_cc
Final Project with React app - at Hamburg Coding School
The aim is to transfer first project by using React app and to have potential Node.js features.
Similar to the first project, we were given 2 weeks to complete. 
For this project, I decided to use React with Bootstrap, since I realised that I should remind and revisit my CSS.
