# projectFin_hcs_cc
Final Project with React app - at Hamburg Coding School
The aim is to transfer first project by using React app and to have potential Node.js features and to deploy the website using Netlify.
Similar to the first project, we were given 2 weeks to complete. 
For this project, I decided to use the React with Bootstrap framework, since I realised that I should revisit CSS flexbox and grid.
This repo has a lot of my earlier mistakes as we were all learning React and it was not (for me) not so easy at the beginning, as I overloaded it will some irrelevant npm packages. There is also a DEPR folder as a reminder of what I have done wrong.
I will be revisiting this repo, as I wasn't able to include some of the bonus tasks for this project, such as including MongoDB, using authentication. Even I was able to look in more on useEffect, I am still keen to try and create another page to "tidy" up the components, have a more realiable app using Wouter and to put "Task" editiing feature to another page. The map and blog page will need another good re-organising. The map has some repetitive information and the blog itself has no pagination and the ability for user to move more freely using the navigation bar.
